# Snake Game

This project is a classic **Snake Game** where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the walls. The goal is to score as many points as possible by eating food without crashing.

## Game Instructions

- **Snake Movement:** Use arrow keys to move the snake in four directions, except for the opposite direction it is heading.
- **Food Generation:** Randomly generates food for the snake to eat.
- **Game Difficulty and Speed:** The snake will move faster in 10 point increments.
- **Score Tracking:** The player's score increases each time the snake eats food by 1 pt.
- **Game Over Conditions:** The game ends if the snake hits the walls or its own body.

### Controls

- **Arrow Keys:** Move the snake up, down, left, or right with keyboard.
